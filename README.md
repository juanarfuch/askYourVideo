🧠CHAT TUBE🤖 - Chat with your videos!
Welcome to CHAT TUBE, a unique chatbot crafted with ❤️ and LOTS OF ☕ by Juan Arfuch. This isn't your everyday chatbot, it's a super bot powered by the mighty trio of LangChain, OpenAI, and Streamlit.

🌟 What's the Magic?
Ever watched an intriguing YouTube video and found yourself bursting with questions? Wished you had someone to chat with right then and there? This is precisely the problem my bot aims to solve.

The chatbot uses the transcript of a YouTube video of your choice to answer your questions! That's right, no more endless scrolling through comments or exhausting internet searches for answers. Just serve our bot with the YouTube video URL, pop the questions, and voila - you have your answers!



🚀 Getting Started:
-Clone this repository to your local machine.
-Install the required Python packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
-Set up your OpenAI API Key in your environment variables or in the st.secrets file.
-Run the app using Streamlit: streamlit run app.py
-Enter the URL of the YouTube video you'd like to chat about.
-Once the video is loaded, ask any questions related to the content of the video.

The bot does the rest!
